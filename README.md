# Pokemon-Battle-Game-OOP
Pokemon Battle is a C++ console game simulating turn-based Pokémon duels using OOP. Choose from six unique Pokémon with distinct types, health, and moves. Use strategic attacks and one-time items to defeat your opponent. Robust exception handling ensures smooth gameplay.


Pokemon Battle is a simple, console-based, turn-based game written in C++ that simulates a Pokémon-style duel using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

Key Features:

Character Class: Defines Pokémon attributes such as name, type, weak type, health, damage, and boosters.
Move Class: Implements various attack moves—including type-based attacks and special moves that exploit opponent weaknesses.
Player Class: Manages player interactions, allowing move selection and the use of one-time items during battle.
Game Class: Orchestrates the game flow, including Pokémon selection and turn-based combat.
Item System: Uses an abstract Item class with derived classes (RestoreHealth, BoostAttack, BoostDefence) to provide strategic advantages.
The project also demonstrates exception handling for robust input validation, making it a great example of applying OOP concepts in C++.
